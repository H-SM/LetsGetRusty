When the winds blew
the sky was dark,
the night was bright,
the silence loud.

When the clouds came,
the world was grey,
the world was cold,
the world was gone.

Before the darkness,
the world was calm,
the houses still,
the people proud.

When the rain left,
the world was brown,
the skies clear,
the people drowned.

Then the sun shone,
the world was born
the people were safe,
the people were warm.

When the winds blew,
the world was grey,
the houses still,
the people drowned.
